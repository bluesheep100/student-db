## What is this?
A checkin system. Specifically for "students" and "teachers". The former checks in and out, and the latter can view and manage the students' checkins and absence.
Schools in Denmark are very fond of tracking student attendance :)

## Why make this?
I need _something_ to do in my free time, don't I?

Jokes aside, I've seen a very common need for a system like this around me in the past few years, so I thought I'd attempt to make it better, and based on Laravel in the hopes that I'd learn something.

## Help wanted
To be blunt, I'm not very good at layout design and putting together frontends for things that I make.
If you want to contribute a new/better frontend for something, there are only a few requirements:
- All views must be Blade components
- No CSS packages; I'd prefer to learn from short and simple CSS
- Use CSS3 Grid for layout, and not flexbox

Please don't hesitate to submit PRs for stuff that isn't frontend. All I ask is that you explain why you do what you do, so that I can learn from it :)

## If you're a business...
In the case that you work for a company based in Denmark, which also happens to want a very competent PHP developer for cheap, I am currently seeking an apprenticeship; or a full-time job following the end of January 2023.
If you're interested, please don't hesitate to email me; I'd love to hear from you :)
